DESCRIPTION
	FOIL is a program that reads extensional specifications of a set of
	relations and produces Horn clause definitions of one or more of them.

INPUT
*****

Input to the program consists of three sections:

        * specification of types
          blank line
        * extensional definitions of relations
          blank line                            |  these are
        * test cases for learned definitions    |  optional

Types
-----

Each discrete type specification consists of the type name followed by a colon,
then a series of constants separated by commas and terminated with a period.
This may occupy several lines and the same constant can appear in many types.

There are three kinds of discrete types:

	* ordered types (type name preceded by '*')
	  The constants have a natural order and appear in this order in
	  the type definition, smallest constant first.
	* unordered types (type name preceded by '#')
	  The constants do not have any natural order.
	* possibly ordered types
	  FOIL will attempt to discover an ordering of the constants that
	  may be useful for recursive definitions.

Each continuous type specification consists of the type name followed by
": continuous." on one line.  The constants corresponding to a continuous type
are the usual integers and real numbers -- any string that can be converted to
a float by C's atof() should work when specifying a value in a tuple.

Constants
---------

A non-numeric constant consist of any string of characters with the exception
that any occurrence of certain delimiter characters (left and right parenthesis,
period, comma, semicolon) must be prefixed by the escape character '\'.
A "theory" constant that can appear in a definition should be preceded by
'*'.  Two one-character constants have a special meaning and should not
be used otherwise:

	* '?' indicates a missing or unknown value
	      (see Cameron-Jones and Quinlan, 1993b)
	* '^' indicates an out-of-closed-world value
	      (see Quinlan and Cameron-Jones, 1994)

Relations
---------

All relations are defined in terms of the set of positive tuples of constants
for which the relation is true, and optionally the set of negative tuples of
constants for which it is false.  If only positive tuples are given, all other
constant tuples of the correct types are considered to be negative.

Each relation is defined by a header and one or two sets of constant tuples.
The header can be specified as follows:

    name(type, type, ... , type) key/key/.../key

The header of all relations other than target relations begins with '*'.
The header consists of relation name, argument types and optional keys.
Keys limit the ways the relation may be used and consist of one character
for each type.  The character '#' indicates that the corresponding argument in
a literal must be bound; the character '-' indicates that the argument can be
bound or unbound.  Each key thus gives a permissible way of accessing the
relation.  If no keys appear, all possible combinations of bound and unbound
arguments are allowed.

Following the header line are a series of lines containing constant tuples:

    positive tuple
    positive tuple
      . . .
    ;			| these
    negative tuple	| are
    negative tuple	| optional
      . . .		|
    .

Each tuple consists of constants separated by commas and must appear on a
single line.  The character ';' separates positive tuples from negative
tuples, which are optional.

Tests
-----

The optional test relations may be given to test the learned Horn clause 
definitions.  The additional input consists of

        a blank line (indicating start of test relation specification)
        relation name
        test tuples
        .
        relation name
        test tuples
        .
          and so on

Each test tuple consists of a constant tuple followed by ": +" if it is 
belongs to the relation and ": -" if it does not.  The definition interpreter is
simple; right-hand sides of the clauses are checked with reference to the
given tuples, not to the definitions of the relations that may have been
learned.

OPTIONS
*******

Options and their meanings are:

        -n      Negative literals are not considered.  This may be useful in
                domains where negated literals wouldn't make sense, or if
                learned definitions must be Horn clauses.

	-N	This is similar, but permits negated equality literals
		A<>B and A<>constant.

        -vverb	Set verbosity level [0, 1, 2, 3, or 4; default 1]
                The program produces rather voluminous trace output controlled
                by this variable.  The default value of 1 gives a fair
                amount of detail; 0 produces very little output; 3 gives
                a blow-by-blow account of what the system is doing;
                4 gives details of tuples in training sets etc.

	-Vvars	Set the maximum number of variables that can be used during
		the search for a definition. [default: 52]

        -sfrac	In some predicates of high arity, the closed world assumption
                will generate very many negative tuples.  This option causes
                only a randomly-selected neg% of negative tuples to be used.
                Note that this option has no effect if negative tuples are
                given explicitly.

	-mmaxt	Set the maximum number of tuples; the default is 100000.
		If the default setting results in warnings that literals are
		being excluded due to the tuple limit, expanding the limit
		may be useful (but time-consuming).

        -ddepth	Set the maximum variable depth [default 4].  This limits the
                possible depth of variables in literals.

	-wwklts Set the maximum number of weak (zero-gain) literals that
		can appear in sequence [default: 4].  A batch of determinate
		literals counts as one literal in this respect.

        -aaccur	Set the minimum accuracy of any clause [default 80%]
                FOIL will not accept any clause with an accuracy lower
                than this.

	-lalter Set the maximum number of alternatives to any literal
		[default 5].  This limits the amount of backup from any 
		one point.

        -tchkpt	Set the maximum number of checkpoints at any one time 
		[default 20].

        -fgain	Any alternative literal must have at least gain%
                of the best literal gain [default 80%].  

        -gmax	Determinate literals are automatically included, unless
                there is a literal which has at least max% of the maximum
                possible gain.  (The maximum possible gain is achieved
                by a literal that is satisfied by all + tuples, but no
                - tuples, in the current training set.)  Obviously, if
                max is zero, no determinate literals are included unless
                there are no other literals.
